"There is one attribute that stands out above all: **consistency**" <br/>
 It's a process. <br/>

### LIVE OVERVIEW DASHBOARD - Keeping an Eagle Eye on Australian Fixed Income market

<br/>
*STIR: 30-day Interbank Cash Rate Futures, 90-day accepted Bill Futures, their spreads, flies, de-flies, condors, other combinations and curve structures.* <br/>
*BONDS: 3-year bond, 10-year bond, yield curve.* <br/>
*Creating this dashboard helped to view the entire Australian Fixed Income futures market in one screen.*

### RISK SCENARIO ANALYSIS - Look at the Range of Outcomes and Be Prepared for it 

![](Screenshots/sa2.PNG)
<br/>
*Case scenarios for front contracts | Meeting impacts on contracts | Contract ranges | Curve movement | Risk-reward ratio* <br/>

*This helped to input basis point expectations for each RBA meeting and check the pricing for different cases, which gave ranges, risk-reward for contracts and combinations. Bottom left side had meeting impact section, which showed meeting impacts on the selected contract or strategy.* <br/> *This showed which trades not to take, more than, which trades to take.* <br/>

*"Sometimes, not taking a trade is a trade itself."*

### PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS - Changing the Game with Metrics and Stats

<br/>
*Analyzing different setups and contracts | Net PnL, Participation and Lot sizing <br/>
Wins vs Losses | Viewing wins & losses objectively* <br/>

*Separating wins and losses helped check the nature of trading strategies objectively. This helped to be defensive on losing (or, not so profitable) strategies and push on the better ones, improving consistency.*
<br/>

*Consistency is not just about making profitable trades every single time. It is about growing a discipline approach to trading that generates reliable results over a long period of time.* <br/>

*__Consistency focus:__* <br/>

- *Market analysts focused on consistency prioritize the reliability and stability of their performance over time. They aim to generate steady returns while minimizing the impact of losses and market volatility.*
- *While consistency focused analysts may not always achieve the highest returns on individual transactions, they aim to maintain a steady and reliable track record of profitability. In turn such an approach can lead to more predictable and manageable outcomes over the long term.*
